# Blinkit E-commerce Sales Performance Analysis (SQL)

## Overview

This project uses **SQL** to perform comprehensive data cleaning, transformation, and analysis on a dataset of Blinkit (e-commerce/retail) sales transactions. The goal was to uncover key sales drivers and operational inefficiencies to provide actionable business intelligence.

## Key Accomplishments

* **Data Integrity:** Performed rigorous SQL data cleaning, notably standardizing the `Item_Fat_Content` column (e.g., unifying 'LF', 'reg' into 'Low Fat', 'Regular').
* **Performance Metrics:** Calculated and presented core Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), including Total Sales, Average Sales, and Average Rating.
* **Strategic Insights:** Identified top-performing products (`Snack Foods`) and high-value store types/locations (`Supermarket Type3`), informing resource allocation.
* **Operational Reporting:** Analyzed sales distribution by `Outlet Size`, `Establishment Year`, and `Item Type` to understand their impact on overall revenue.

## Technologies Used

* **SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL Syntax)**
* **Data Cleaning:** Used `UPDATE` and `CASE` statements for standardization.
* **Data Manipulation:** Applied `ALTER TABLE` and `GROUP BY` for data structure and aggregation.
* **Advanced Aggregation:** Employed `SUM`, `AVG`, and window functions for detailed reporting.

## Files

* `Blinkit SQL analysis.sql`: Contains all the SQL queries used for cleaning, KPI calculation, and in-depth analysis.
* `[Your_Data_File.csv or .xlsx]`: (Mention the name of the original data file, if applicable)
